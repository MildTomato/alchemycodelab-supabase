This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Set up Supabase

Go through these steps first, before running the client

1. **Create a Supabase project**

Go to [app.supabase.io](https://app.supabase.io) and create an account.

You'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account

You may have watched me (@MildTomato) earlier in the hackathon making the table and policies using the supabase dashboard.

You may not remember what I did, so you can just run the below in the SQL editor, to add all the things you need to get going.
Below is the SQL required to setup the project, it will create the table and also set up the RLS policies.
Copy the whole snippet and run it in the SQL editor.

```sql

-- Create a table called `tasks` for the tasks

CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  inserted_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
  task text,
  checked boolean DEFAULT false NOT NULL
)

-- Create policies for Row Level Security

CREATE POLICY "Enable INSERT for users whose uid equals user_id" ON public.tasks FOR
INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Enable SELECT for users whose uid equals user_id" ON public.tasks FOR
SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Enable UPDATE for users whose uid equals user_id" ON public.tasks FOR
UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id) WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

```

## Running the client

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
